For example, you may wish to display certain attributes for a subset of users and not others, or you may wish to always include certain relationships in the JSON representation of your models. Eloquent's resource classes allow you to expressively and easily transform your models and model collections into JSON. Of course, you may always convert Eloquent models or collections to JSON using their toJson methods; however, Eloquent resources provide more granular and robust control over the JSON serialization of your models and their relationships. = ${content}`,

The Laravel Schema facade provides database agnostic support for creating and manipulating tables across all of Laravel's supported database systems. Typically, migrations will use this facade to create and modify database tables and columns. = ${content}`,
